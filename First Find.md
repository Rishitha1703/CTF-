### Solution in Kali/Linux/Ubuntu:
### Steps to Solve:
1. **Download the ZIP file**:
   Use `wget` to download the provided file from the challenge link:
   ```bash
   wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/502/files.zip
   ```

2. **Inspect the ZIP file**:
   Use the `cat` command to examine the content of the ZIP file in text form:
   ```bash
   cat files.zip
   ```
   This may reveal encoded or unusual content.

3. **Search for readable strings**:
   Use the `strings` command to extract human-readable text from the binary data, and combine it with `grep` to filter lines containing the keyword `pico`:
   ```bash
   strings files.zip | grep pico
   ```
   This will display any flag or clue starting with "pico."

4. **Retrieve the Flag**:
   The command should yield the required flag for submission in the challenge.

### Takeaways:
- The `strings` command is invaluable in CTF challenges for extracting plaintext from binary files.
- Combining `grep` with `strings` narrows down results, making it easier to find the relevant information.
- The methodology is similar to challenges like "Big Zip" or "Static Ainâ€™t Always Noise," emphasizing enumeration and filtering techniques.

### Tools Used:
- **wget**: Downloads files from a URL.
- **cat**: Displays file contents.
- **strings**: Extracts readable strings from binary files.
- **grep**: Searches for patterns within text.
