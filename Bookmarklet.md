### Description  
Why search for the flag manually when I can use a bookmarklet to reveal it instantly?  
Just browse to the page and find the flag!  

### Solution  
When you visit the site, you'll see a JavaScript snippet labeled as a "bookmarklet for you to try." There are several ways to use it:  

1. **Using a Bookmarklet:**  
   - Bookmark the page and then edit the bookmark.  
   - Replace the URL with the provided JavaScript code.  
   - Click the bookmark, and a pop-up will display the flag.  
   - In Chrome, you may need to select "Choose another folder..." under "Folder" when editing the bookmark.  

2. **Using an Online Compiler:**  
   - Copy and paste the JavaScript into an [online JavaScript compiler](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/).  
   - Run the script to reveal the flag.  

**Flag:** `picoCTF{p@g3_turn3r_e8b...}`
