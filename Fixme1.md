<h1>Solution</h1>
This challenge aims to improve Python code-reading skills. Unlike Java, which uses `{}` to define code blocks, Python relies on proper indentation.

The given Python code snippet had a minor indentation issue in the last line. The `print` statement was indented unnecessarily, making it appear as part of a block, even though it should align with the `flag` assignment, which is at the top level.

In the original code, the variable `flag` is assigned the result of the `str_xor` function. The subsequent `print` statement, however, is incorrectly indented by two spaces, which is inconsistent with Python's indentation rules.

To resolve this, the extra spaces before the `print` statement were removed, aligning it properly with the `flag` assignment. Below is the corrected portion of the code:

```python
flag = str_xor(flag_enc, 'enkidu')

print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
```
