The steps provided outline a process to search for a specific word within files contained in a zip archive:

---

**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the directory where the file was downloaded:  
   ```bash
   cd Downloads
   ```

2. **Unzip the archive:**  
   ```bash
   unzip big-zip-files.zip
   ```

3. **Search for the word:**  
   ```bash
   grep -r "pico" .
   ```
   - The `-r` flag allows recursive search through all files and directories.
   - Replace `"pico"` with the desired word or pattern you wish to search for.
