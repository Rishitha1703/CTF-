To fix the code and test it, follow these steps:

### 1. **Update the Code**
Locate the line where the variable `flag` is being checked. Update it by replacing the single `=` with a double `==` to ensure a comparison instead of an assignment.

Original problematic line:  
```python
if flag = "":
```  

Updated line:  
```python
if flag == "":
```

### 2. **Save the File**
After making the correction, save the file.

### 3. **Run the Code**
Execute the updated Python script in your terminal using the following command:

```bash
$ python3 filename.py
```

### 4. **Output**
Once the code runs successfully, it will output:  

```
picoCTF{3qu4l1ty_n0t_4551gnm3nt_4863e11b}
```
